//Establish vectors.

//Inside setup:

  //Set random position and speed for vectors

//Inside draw:

  //Change the value of the vector by adding the speed value

  //Draw the star at the value of the vector

  //If the star is off the screen reset the x position, and randomize the y position and speed
